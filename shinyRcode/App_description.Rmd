## Application goal

This online application based on `shiny` R package allows to visualize and impute fishery commodities production data at national (semi-standardized) level. An additional step, not included in the app is needed to obtain values at International Standard Statistical Classification of Fishery Commodities (ISSCFC) level.

The application proposes four different imputation options: **ensemble model** based approach, **export** based approach, **primary production** based approach and the possibility to insert a manual value. 

The ensemble model option is directly provided by the application using an internal R function[^1], whereas the three other method are almost entirely customizable by the user.

[^1]: the user can find the functions in the `faoswsImputation` package on the GitHub repository **SWS-Methodology** (<https://github.com/SWS-Methodology/faoswsImputation/tree/master/R>).

Export and primary production based approaches are based on mappings either provided by the technical unit or automatically generated using the reference file YBKlang.
These mappings are stored in the Statistical Working System (SWS) as data tables (ISSCFC Mapping - Export Approach, *isscfc_mapping_export_approach* and ISSCFC Mapping - Primary Prod Approach, *isscfc_mapping_prod_approach*).
Given the semi-standardized nature of fishery production questionnaires, also production data are stored in data tables. The raw data are in data table *processed_prod_national_detail_raw* and data including imputed values are in data table *processed_prod_national_detail_imputed*.

The process is performed imputing values by country, year and commodity. 
As first step, the user sets these parameters from the interactive menu on the left side and visualizes data accordingly.
The user can review and customize the export and primary production based approaches modifying the mapping directly on the shiny tabs.
Once the user has compared the different approaches and has chosen the imputation value, a validation button is available to update the dataset directly in the Statistical Working System (SWS). 


## Application structure

The application has seven working tabs, all sharing the same side menu where the user select data, plus an 'About' tab.
The tab names are: 'National mapping', 'Export approach', 'Primary Prod. approach', 'Summary', 'Save Export Mapping', 'Save Primary Prod. Mapping', 'Data aggregates' and 'About'.

The side menu has six fields to help the user select the data:

a. **Country**: with this button the user selects the country to analyze. The list includes all the countries in the M49 classification code list. Both the country name and code are shown and the user can look for the country taping either of them. If there are no data for the country selected the user would not be able to select anything else and a message will appear suggesting to choose another country.

b. **Imputation year**: the user can select the year of interest for the imputation. The years listed are those present in the '`processed_prod_national_detail_raw`' data table for the chosen country, sorted in descending order.

c. **Starting year**: it is the year the user wants to check the time series from. This choice has mainly visualization purpose but it also affects the average ratio value in the export and primary production approaches. Changes in the mapping only affect data from imputation year onward and imputations is made only for the chosen imputation year. If for the export or primary production approach there are no data available to impute processed production, a message appears showing what years are available within the chosen period. For example, if the chosen period is 2010-2017 and data are missing for years 2012-2017 the app returns a message saying that the years available are only 2010 and 2011. 
By default, the first year available is the year before the previously selected imputation year.

d. **Missing**: This button filters the commodities displayed in the last field (Commodity) and it has three options: "Yes", "No" and "Not to impute". If the user selects "Yes" then the commodities shown are commodities with missing data that have to be imputed. These data do not appear in the '`processed_prod_national_detail_raw`' data table but they are created in the '`processed_prod_national_detail_imputed`' data table with value $0$ and flags (M, u) with a specific R function. Please note that this flag is the one used by the system to identify and impute missing data. Flags change once imputation is validated. 
The missing data to be imputed are identified by an internal function that analyses the information contained in the time series. If the series contains only zeros and missing values flagged as (M,-) or (O,-) then it is considered to contain no information for imputation. Otherwise, if information is available, the cell can be imputed and it is included in the list of missing values to impute with flags (M, u). 
The option "No" filters all the commodities with non missing figures, i.e. with an observation status flag different from 'M' or 'O'. These data do not need imputation, nevertheless, the user can still review these data and assign a different value if necessary. 
The third option "Not to impute" has been introduced for the user to see all the series with flags (M, -) or (O, -) meaning that the series is either not active anymore or the datum selected is missing and is not to impute. As in the previous case, the user can still perform imputation and validation steps if necessary.

e. Commodity: last filter listing commodities corresponding to the previous choices. Even if the imputation is at national commodity level, along with the _scheda_ code, the list also shows the ISSCFC code and label associated to the scheda.  

Once inputs are chosen, they should remain the same during the whole procedure to ensure consistency and avoid errors. Nevertheless, the user can change the input at any time. If a filter changes, the filters following the changed one will have to be selected again. Figure \@ref(fig:firsttab) shows the Shiny app after all inputs have been fixed along with the first table appearing in the first tab.

### 'National mapping' tab


In this first tab the user visualizes the imputed data table *processed_prod_national_detail_imputed* as it is in the SWS. In this way all commodities for the period selected can be checked along with the approach used for the previously imputed values.
This table cannot be modified and only has consultation purpose.

The button 'Check new items' performs the following checks on the imputed table:

a. If a new commodity has appeared since the last update it shows the message 'A new commodity has appeared in the processed production table since last update. Commodity: ...'

b. If a new scheda has appeared since the last update it shows the message 'A new Scheda has appeared in the processed production table since last update. Commodity: ...'

If no new product has appeared in the updating process of the data table then the message is 'No new commodity or scheda has appeared since last update.'.


### 'Export approach' tab

The imputation approach based on export data assumes the proportion between export and production of a commodity is, on average, stable over time for each country. The missing processed production is calculated multiplying the export data by the average ratio between the produced and exported quantity of the chosen commodity during the period selected. The kind of ratio applied depends on the choice of the light blue buttons in the center of the page and the possibility to insert a manual ratio appears in a separate box when choosing the option 'Manual ratio' in the light blue buttons. Ratio button choices: 'Original data', 'Average ratio', 'Manual ratio'. As export data are sometimes more detailed than production ones, a mapping relating ISSCFC codes for commodity production to ISSCFC codes for commodity export has been created. The mapping is of the form one (production code) to one or many (export codes) and can be updated in the export approach tab through the first table appearing on the top of the page.
Once the user is satisfied with the new mapping, the initial mapping can be updated with the button 'Update mapping'. The effect of this update on the mapping can be checked on the 'Check mapping export approach' tab and then transferred to the data table in the SWS.
The processed production value computed is shown in the red bordered cells in the second tables in the export approach tab and will be displayed in the summary tab where the user can compare it with values deriving from other approaches.

**Tab elements:**

The 'Export approach' tab shows two tables, a graph, a 'Check mapping', an 'Update mapping' and a 'Ratio choice' button. 

The upper table has twelve columns:

1. 'Selection': with this column the user can change the mapping. Checking and unchecking the exported commodities they are included or excluded from the processed production calculation.

2. 'type': it refers to the type of mapping of the row. If the mapping has been 'provided' by the FIAS unit or if it has been created automatically by matching commodities with the same code in production and export.

3. 'description': the name of the exported commodity in the row (names are those contained in the SWS reference list).

4. 'measuredItemISSCFC_exp': ISSCFC codes referring to the export commodity mapped to the ISSCFC production code.

5. 'Value_exp': value in tonnes of the exported commodity.

6. 'flagObservationStatus_exp': SDMX observation status flag of the export data

7. 'flagMethod_exp': SDMX method flag of the export data

8. 'timePointYears': the imputation year.

9. 'nationaldescription': description provided by the country for the commodity to impute (taken from the data table with raw data).

10. 'remarks': remarks provided by the country or inserted by the FIAS unit for the commodity to impute (taken from the data table with raw data).

11. 'Scheda': the code associated to the national commodity to impute.

12. 'measuredItemISSCFC': ISSCFC code referring to the Scheda

Modifying this table the user can change the mapping previously in use. The user can add, remove, check or uncheck rows. In general it is recommended not to remove rows but only to uncheck unnecessary mappings so that unchecked rows can always be reintroduced and evidence of the old mapping is kept in the table the user visualizes.
Once the user is satisfied with the changes the mapping can be updated clicking on the button 'Update mapping'. Changes in the mapping can be visualized in the 'Check mapping export approach' tab.
In order to update the mapping only the type, export commodity and commodity cell should be compiled. The other information is retrieved automatically. The only fields kept in memory and updated are those also appearing in the mapping table provided by the FIAS unit and appearing in the SWS, i.e. measuredItemISSCFC, measuredItemISSCFC_exp, type and Selection. Country, start year and end year are automatically assigned.

Note that the application only updates the mapping if the 'Update' button is pressed. After updating the mapping the user can revise the final mappings in the tabs 'Check export approach mapping' and 'Check prod approach mapping'. If the user is satisfied with the mappings then to apply the changes to the data table in the SWS the button 'Save mapping in SWS' has to be pressed. These two steps ensure that all changes are consistent with the user's choices. This also applies to the primary production mapping update.

When the user updates the mapping its consistency can be checked clicking the button 'Check mapping'. It is advisable to perform this operation before starting any activity and regularly after few updates.

Clicking the button the following checks are performed:

a. If there is more than one mapping for the same commodity which has 'LAST' as end year. This is an inconsistency as it means that there are two periods in the data table for the same mapping. The Shiny should warn the user if something similar is happening when updating the mapping. Message: 'INCONSISTENCY! The chosen commodity has two start years for the same end year (LAST). Please check in the SWS mapping data table.'  

b. If the imputation year is older than the current mapping, i.e. the mapping has already changed since the year the user wants to impute, this could cause an inconsistency in the mapping. Therefore, the Shiny app returns the message: 'The mapping has already changed since the chosen imputation year. Please update the mapping manually coherently to avoid automatic errors.' The user can then manually change the mapping possibly correcting for retroactive changes.
                
c. If the same exported commodity has been allocated twice, i.e. there is a duplication in the mapping for the last period, then the app returns the message: 'The mapping implies a duplication. Please check commodity(ies): ...'.
                                            
d. If a new commodity appears in the national production list which is not included in the mapping the the message shown is 'The following items have production figures but are not included in the export approach mapping table: ...' 

e. Linked to the previous point, if the export quantity corresponding to the new commodity appearing in the production list is linked to another commodity for the same country the message appearing is 'The following commodity(ies) have export quantities linked to another commodity code in the mapping table: ...'

f. If a commodity, which is in the mapping as an export commodity, has not been allocated the message is: 'The following commodity(ies) have not been included in the mapping: ...'.

g. If mapping validity periods overlap, e.g. if mapping for a commodity X has two mappings, one for period 1 and one for period 2 where: start_year1 = 1948, end_year1 = 2015 and start_year2 = 2012, end_year2 = 'LAST', because the two periods overlap for years 2012-2015 the message shown is: 'This current mapping implies an inconsistent allocation. Two validity periods overlap for commodity(ies): ...'.
      
If no inconsistency is found then the button returns the message 'The current mapping is consistent.'

These messages do not prevent the user from proceeding. They only appear if the user presses the 'Check mapping' button. Conversely, there are cases when either the approach is not applicable or there is a clear error in what has been inserted by the user. In these cases the app shows messages the user has to address before continuing any activity. 
These messages are:

a. 'Export approach not applicable. No available mapping for the chosen country.': if there is no available mapping for the chosen country.

b. 'Export approach not applicable. No available export value for the chosen input combination.': if there is no export value associated to the chosen commodity.

c. 'Export data for the time range and commodity selected are not available. Years available: ...': if no export data is available for the time range selected. In this case the app shows (within the chosen time range) the years available for which the approach is applicable.

d. 'Export approach not applicable. Calculations for this commodity cannot be performed.': if for any reason the calculations required cannot be performed. If this message appears, please contact the person in charge of the code as it likely an error that needs to be fixed in the code and does not depend on the user.

e. 'The commodity inserted in the measuredItemISSCFC column is not in the commodity list. ... is not a valid code.': all the code inserted in the mapping table have to be in the commodity list used in the SWS, if the commodity inserted does not belong to this list either there is an error in the inserted code or the list of commodities in SWS has to be updated.

f. 'The commodity inserted in the measuredItemISSCFC_exp column is not in the commodity list. ... is not a valid code.': same as the previous one but for the export commodities.

As the user changes the mapping the consequences of the change are visible in the table and the graph in the page.

The second table in the tab has three rows: processed production volume, export volume and ratio row. The time series for these data is shown for all the selected period (start year - imputation year). The processed production row shows beside each value the associated flag; the export row shows the sum of all the commodities in the mapping (if more than one) and the aggregated flag associated; the ratio row shows the ratio between the processed production and the export volumes for each year. The last column contains the average values calculated for the selected years but the imputation year.
The table is dynamic and changes according to the mapping but changes only affect the imputation year.
What happens in the table is graphically shown in the plot below the table displaying time series for export and processed production volumes (in tonnes).
The user can choose what ratio to apply to calculate the processed production estimate. By default the original data is shown (if available), if data are missing the average ratio is used. If the user wants a manual ratio can be inserted clicking on the button 'Manual ratio'.


### 'Primary production approach' tab

The approach based on primary production uses the data in the 'Global production' dataset (union between Capture and Aquaculture productions) classified according to ASFIS alphacodes.
The connection between species and commodities is based on ISSCAAP groups. The mapping for the primary production approach connects each commodity to one or more ISSCAAP groups and, within each ISSCAAP group, to either a list or to all the species belonging to the groups. Since each ISSCAAP group and each species can be associated to more than one commodity, it is possible for the user to set the ratio (or share) of each species to allocate to the commodity. In this way the production can be split across different commodities. By default the ratio is set to 1.

As in the export approach, the missing processed production is calculated multiplying the primary production mapped to the commodity of the chosen imputation year by the average ratio between the processed and primary production of the chosen commodity during the period selected. Also in this case, there is the possibility to insert a manual ratio changing the ratio choice with the light blue buttons. Choices: 'Original data', 'Average ratio', 'Manual ratio'.
By default in the tab all the species produced in the selected country are shown (even if production in the selected year is zero). Then the user can check (uncheck) species to include (exclude) from the mapping, or just change the ratio/share of species to be associated to the commodity.

Once the user is satisfied with the new mapping, the initial mapping can be updated with the button 'Update mapping'. The effect of this update on the mapping can be checked on the 'Check mapping prod approach' tab and then transferred to the data table in the SWS.
The processed production value computed is shown in the red bordered cells in the second tables in the Primary Prod. approach tab and will be displayed in the summary tab where the user can compare it with values deriving from other approaches.

**Tab elements:**

The 'Primary Prod. approach' tab shows two tables, a graph, a 'Check mapping', an 'Update mapping' and a 'Ratio choice' button.

The first table has fourteen columns: 

1. 'Selection': with this column the user can change the mapping. Checking and unchecking species they are included or excluded from the processed production calculation.

2. 'type': it refers to the type of mapping of the row. If the mapping has been 'provided' by the FIAS unit or if it has been created automatically by matching commodities with the same code in production and export.

3. 'Ratio': it is the share of production for the species to be mapped to the commodity, so the same species can be mapped to more than one commodity avoiding allocating for more than 100% of the production.

4. 'isscaap': the ISSCAAP group corresponding to the species.

5. 'description': the English name of the species in the row (names are those contained in the SWS reference list).

6. 'frisheriesAsfis': ASFIS alphacode referring to the species.

7. 'Value_PrimaryProd': value in tonnes produced for the species.

8. 'flagObservationStatus_PrimaryProd':  SDMX observation status flag of the primary production value.

9. 'flagMethod_PrimaryProd':  SDMX method flag of the primary production value.

10. 'timePointYears': the imputation year.

11. 'nationaldescription': description provided by the country for the commodity to impute (taken from the data table with raw data).

12. 'remarks': remarks provided by the country or inserted by the FIAS unit for the commodity to impute (taken from the data table with raw data).

13. 'Scheda': the code associated to the national commodity to impute.

14. 'measuredItemISSCFC': ISSCFC code referring to the Scheda

Modifying this table the user can change the mapping previously in use. The user can add, remove, check or uncheck rows. In general, it is recommended not to remove rows but only to uncheck unnecessary mappings so that unchecked rows can always be reintroduced and evidence of the old mapping is kept in the table the user visualizes.
Once the user is satisfied with the changes in the mapping the mapping can be updated clicking on the button 'Update mapping'. Changes in the mapping can be visualized in the 'Check mapping prod approach' tab. 
In order to update the mapping only the type, species, ISSCAAP and commodity cells have to be compiled. The other information is retrieved automatically. Please note that the only fields modifiable are those also appearing in the mapping table provided by the FIAS unit and in the SWS, i.e. fisheriesAsfis, isscaap, measuredItemISSCFC, type and Selection. Country, start year and end year are automatically assigned.

When the user updates the mapping its consistency can be checked clicking the button 'Check mapping'. It is advisable to perform this operation before starting any activity and regularly after few updates.

Clicking the button the following checks are performed (please note that checks a, b and d are the same as for the export approach):

a. If there is more than one mapping which has 'LAST' as end year. This is an inconsistency, as it means that there are two periods in the data table for the same mapping. The Shiny warns the user if something similar happens when updating the mapping. Message: 'INCONSISTENCY! The chosen commodity has two start years for the same end year (LAST). Please check in the SWS mapping data table.'  

b. If the imputation year is older than the current mapping, i.e. the mapping has already changed since the year the user wants to impute, this could cause an inconsistency in the mapping. Therefore, the Shiny app returns the message: 'The mapping has already changed since the chosen imputation year. Please update the mapping manually coherently to avoid automatic errors.' The user can then manually change the mapping possibly correcting for retroactive changes.
  
c. If the same ISSCAAP group is mapped to more than one commodity this is notified by the message: 'ISSCAAP group(s) ... is (are) mapped to more than one commodity for this country.' 

d. If a new commodity appears in the national production list which is not included in the mapping the message shown is 'The following items have production figures but are not included in the export approach mapping table: ...'.

e. If more than 100% of the primary production for one species has been allocated, then the app returns the message 'More than 100% of the available primary production has been allocated for species ...'

If no inconsistency is found, then the button returns the message 'The current mapping is consistent.'

As in the export approach, these messages do not prevent the user from proceeding. 
The messages the user has to address before continuing any activity are:

a. If there is no primary production approach mapping provided for the whole country 'Primary production approach not applicable. No available mapping for the chosen country.'.

b. If no data is available for the chosen parameters: 'Primary production data for the country, time range and commodity selected are not available. Please select different inputs or ignore this approach.'

c. When modifying the mapping table in the tab, if a commodity code is not valid, or it is NA then the following message appears: 'One of the commodity inserted in the measuredItemISSCFC column is not in the commodity list. ... is not a valid code.'

d. As in point 'c', the same happens if the species inserted is not valid.

e. Along with the new species, also ISSCAAP group is a necessary information when adding a mapping in the table so if not inserted the app asks for it: 'Please enter Isscaap group for species ...'

f. If the ISSCAAP group inserted is not the one appearing in the data table used for mapping then the message 'Please assign species to the right ISSCAAP group(s).' is returned.

The second table has the same structure as the second table in the 'Export approach' tab but, instead of the exports volume, the primary production volume is shown. 


### Summary and  check mappings tabs

The 'Summary' tab contains results from the two previous approaches, it proposes a value calculated using the ensemble method approach ^[Statistical Working Paper on Imputation Methodology for the FAOSTAT Production Domain. Joshua M. Browning, Michael C. J. Kao, Francesca Rosa. Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations.] and, in addition, the possibility to insert a manual input and the original data (if available). The user can see the values in the plot, along with the time series since the start year selected, and choose which value to impute in the dataset. Once the user has selected the approach, the imputation and the dataset update is performed clicking on the 'Impute value' button and the data table *processed_prod_national_detail_imputed* is automatically updated.
A box to update the remark field is also provided.

There are then two checking tabs where the user can see the result of the mapping updates performed in the export and primary production tabs. This last step is necessary to ensure errors in the updates or unwanted updates are saved into the SWS and used for the next imputations. The tables shown in the app exactly reproduce the data tables stored in the SWS.

In case links are available for the commodity selected they will be displayed in a modifiable tab at the top of the page. The purpose of this table is to allow the user to add mappings in case no link in shown in the Export/Primary Prod. approach tab.
It is therefore a **last resort tool** to avoid changing the mapping table directly in SWS but if possible the user should always prefer to make changes in the Export/Primary Prod. approach tab.

The data aggregates tabs allows the user to check the aggregated quantities so to get an overview of the impact the single scheda validation has on a larger scale. The aggregate proposed are the Grand total (sum of all the scheda), the so called Yearbook total (main groups from 1 to 7), Main groups (total by group) and ISSCFC Total (scheda aggregation by *scheda*).
